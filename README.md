### Pilot Studies

The project is currently in the pilot studies phase. To view the results of the pilot studies, visit:
- [**Pilot Study on Partitioning**](https://github.com/DominikDziedzic/PilotStudyPartitioning) that examined the interplay between pre-experimentally and experimentally acquired knowledge after limited training
- [**Pilot Study on Sampling**](https://github.com/DominikDziedzic/PilotStudySampling) that demonstrated the causal relationship between value, probability, and responses to David Kaplan's 'Carnap vs. Agnew' case concerning the reference of demonstratives

### Synopsis

To ensure generalizability, the project aims to run similar studies on at least three widely discussed philosophical thought experiments. To this end, three of the following thought experiments will be converted to experimental materials and used consistently in all planned studies: a Gettier case, the ‘famous violinist’ case, the case of the ‘philosophical zombie’, the inverted spectrum scenario or ‘Mary the super-scientist’ thought experiment, the Molyneux’s problem or one of many cases concerning the relationship between perception and thinking (e.g., a case of switching two objects that look the same), Tyler Burge’s ‘arthritis’ thought experiment or David Kaplan’s ‘Carnap vs. Agnew’ case concerning demonstratives. These cases trigger intuitive judgments of different logical forms, e.g., the Gettier cases involve the application of the concept of knowledge (i.e. judgment of the form _x_ is _F_); the ‘famous violinist’ case triggers judgment of the soundness of analogy; the ‘philosophical zombie’ case triggers modal judgments. Showing that a default sampling mechanism influences intuitive claims of different logical forms would support the generalizability of the proposed theory across thought experiments and scenarios.
